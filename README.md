# Academic-resource-page-for-1st-year-students
As 1st semester students, finding study materials like notes, previous question papers, and useful videos can be difficult. This website is designed to help students easily access all necessary resources in one place.  Currently, it includes 1st semester C-Cycle materials, and more content will be added in future semesters.
